Create a detailed, photorealistic image of a realistic domestic cat actively installing RAM sticks into an open consumer-grade PC case with an extreme RAM configuration.
Cat Subject Requirements:

Fully realistic tabby cat - standard quadrupedal feline anatomy
Detailed fur textures with visible individual hairs and stripes
Cat positioned on desk, both front paws carefully gripping a single RAM stick, placing it into a slot
Focused, intent expression with ears slightly forward
Natural cat proportions, sitting upright to reach the motherboard

Computer & Hardware Requirements - CRITICAL:

EXTREME RAM CONFIGURATION: Motherboard with 32 RAM slots arranged in a massive extended row spanning the entire top edge of the motherboard
30 RGB RAM sticks already installed - creating a spectacular wall of illuminated memory modules in rainbow colors
Only 2 empty slots remaining, cat installing stick #30
The RAM sticks should be the visual focal point - an absurdly long row of colorful memory modules
Large NVIDIA RTX 6090 graphics card with triple-fan design and illuminated "6090" branding
Open mid-tower case with glass panel removed
AIO liquid cooler, RGB fans, clean cable management

Environment & Composition:

Clean desk with anti-static mat
RAM packaging boxes scattered nearby
Soft lighting with RGB glow illuminating cat's fur

Overall Style: Hyperrealistic photography, humorous tech enthusiast scene, emphasis on the ridiculous quantity of RAM sticks as the key visual element.
